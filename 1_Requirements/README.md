#### Requirements
Airline booking system is based on the objective of providing the customers/users an easy way for making reservations, placing cancellation and checking their reservations. This airline booking system will help the customers to book their tickets in a hassle-free manner and make seats available as soon as there is a cancellation placed.
# Research/State of Art 
The present Airline booking system has counters at the airport where customers have to go to make reservations, cancel tickets and check reservations. There are travel agents who take advance bookings and provide tickets to customers at a higher cost than the actual cost also cancellation needs to be done at the counters and travel agents well in advance which is very lengthy and tedious process.
# Cost and Timeline
| Time line  |   Changes in the Airline Booking System   |
| --------- | ------ |
|1964-1971 | The airline bookings witnessed rapid growth of customers but used manual systems.  |
| Late 1976 | Partial semi-automatic systems were used with complicated mechanical computers to show seat availability  |
| Early 2000|Programmed airline reservations were used similar to previous systems. |
| 2000-    2003 | GDS centric distribution model was used -Travel agencies were connected to various airlines, and terminals that provided access to GDS content  |
|2003-  2009     |GDS system became independent and first electronic ticket . |

Various technology devices made it easy for the end user to access travel data, compare prices, and book electronic tickets stored in smartphone memory. But even now, all flight information still comes from GDSs by channels established in the 1960s and has Third Parties involved which in turn increase the cost for the end user.
